A Ruby application to "hide images within plain sight". Given an image file and a text file as inputs,
produces (on standard output) a HTML file which at a glance appears to contain the monospaced text
from the text file. However, when the text is selected with the cursor, the image becomes apparent.
The image is encoded in CSS as a series of rgb() values on ::selected selectors (with ::-moz-selected
selectors for compatability with Firefox).

Prerequisites:

* Requires the RMagick gem to be installed. You're on your own with that.

Usage:

 ruby picinhtml.rb image-file text-file

Usage example:

 ruby picinhtml.rb my-cat.jpg magna-carta.txt > output.html

Samples:

Two sample images, text files, and their outputs are included in the examples directory.

 * Example 1 is a GIF file containing a splash of colour, mapped onto the book of Genesis.
 * Example 2 is a JPG file containing a picture of a lifeboatman, mapped onto the terms and conditions of a software company.

Recommendations:

 * This application produces monsterously huge HTML files. Keep your image files small to minimize their enormity. As a maximum, I suggest no more than 10,000 pixels (100x100), or else the resulting output is liable to crash web browsers.
 * The tool optimises for color reuse. Posterised images, and those with fewer colors will always work better. GIF and PNG images tend to work better than JPGs.
